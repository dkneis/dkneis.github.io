# R package `rodeo`

## Basic information
[`rodeo`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rodeo) is an add-on package for the statistical computing software [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/). It facilitates the implementation of mechanistic models built on ordinary differential equations (ODE). Its heart is a code generator whose output (Fortran95+ or R) can be passed to numerical solvers, namely those from the packages [deSolve](http://cran.r-project.org/package=deSolve) and [rootSolve](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rootSolve).

The [extended documentation (PDF)](https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo/blob/master/vignettes/rodeoVignette.pdf) for the `rodeo` package describes basic functionalities and contains many examples. A brief overview on the package's objectives and concepts is given in [this presentation (PDF)](rodeo/presentations/seminarSIAM_20160503.pdf). Interactive modeling examples some of which are implemented with `rodeo` are hosted at a [dedicated server](http://limno-live.hydro.tu-dresden.de) maintained by TU Dresden, Institute of Hydrobiology.

The latest version is available in the project's [source code repository](https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo). It can be installed as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library('devtools')
install_github('dkneis/rodeo')
```

There is also a release version of `rodeo` on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rodeo). However, due to ongoing development, this version may be somewhat outdated.

## Demo examples

A set of demo examples is contained in the package vignette (see link above). The related data and scripts are shipped with the package (see folder `rodeo/doc/examples` after installation). To find the actual location of that folder, use

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
system.file("doc/examples",package="rodeo")
```

To run the examples, you need

- the *development version* of the package (see above),

- a recent version of [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/),

- the developer tools to compile Fortran code.

Regarding the last point, I prepared a short PDF document with [minimalistic instructions](rodeo/instructions/installShort.pdf). In case of problems, please consult the official [administration and installation guide](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html), especially the appendices.

# Other R packages

The following packages are not 'officially' released and they are not uploaded on CRAN. The links direct to the respective source code repositories.

* [Generic GUI for `rodeo`-based 0-dimensional models](https://github.com/dkneis/rodeoApp); deprecated (2016-08-01)

# R-related material

| Topics               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Sensitivity analysis | Analyzing the sensitivity of models with respect to input parameters is a common task. I wrote a [minimalistic guide](r-related/sensitivityGuide.html) on that topic which is a reference for myself but also a kind of tutorial. The described methods are applicable to models implemented with [`rodeo`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rodeo), for example. You can help to improve the document by sending me feedback (bug reports, suggestions for simplification or extension). |

# Other software

* The [ECHSE](http://echse.github.io/) framework for rapid development of hydrological model engines (implemented in C++).
