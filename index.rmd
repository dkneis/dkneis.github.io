# R package `rodeo`

## Basic information
[`rodeo`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rodeo) is an add-on package for the statistical computing software [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/). It facilitates the implementation of mechanistic models built on ordinary differential equations (ODE). Its heart is a code generator whose output (Fortran95+ or R) can be passed to numerical solvers, namely those from the packages [deSolve](http://cran.r-project.org/package=deSolve) and [rootSolve](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rootSolve).

The extended documentation for the package (vignette in PDF format) is available for [download](https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo/raw/master/vignettes/rodeo.pdf) here and it can also be [viewed](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo/raw/master/vignettes/rodeo.pdf) via google docs. An introductive presentation (PDF file) is provided at [this link](rodeo/presentations/seminarSIAM_20160503.pdf). Interactive modeling examples some of which are implemented with `rodeo` are hosted [here](http://limno-live.hydro.tu-dresden.de) (maintained by TU Dresden, Institute of Hydrobiology).

The latest version is available in the project's [source code repository](https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo). It can be installed as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library('devtools')
install_github('dkneis/rodeo')
```

There is also a release version of `rodeo` on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rodeo). However, due to ongoing development, this version may be somewhat outdated.

## Demo examples

A set of demo examples is provided with the package. To try them out, you need a recent version of [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/), preferrably  including the developer tools to compile Fortran code. I prepared a short PDF document with [minimalistic instructions](rodeo/instructions/installShort.pdf). In case of problems, please consult the official [administration and installation guide](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html), especially the appendices. The examples can also be run without the developer tools at the cost of worse performance, i.e. increased computation time (see below).

The demo examples can be found in the `examples` folder of the `rodeo` installation directory whose name should be returned by

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
system.file("examples",package="rodeo")
```

and the contents may be listed as follows

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
list.files(system.file("examples",package="rodeo"), recursive=TRUE)
```

Each of the sub-folders contains a file `README.txt` as well as a file `run.r` to run the example. Open the latter file in your preferred R editor or IDE and set R's working directory to the folder where `run.r` resides. Adjustable parameters of the models can be found at the top of the file. In particular, you should make sure to use

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
compile= FALSE
```

if the developer tools (see above) are **not** installed.

# Other R packages

The following packages are not 'officially' released and they are not uploaded on CRAN. The links direct to the respective source code repositories.

* [Generic GUI for `rodeo`-based 0-dimensional models](https://github.com/dkneis/rodeoApp); deprecated (2016-08-01)

# R-related material

| Topics               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Sensitivity analysis | Analyzing the sensitivity of models with respect to input parameters is a common task. I wrote a [minimalistic guide](r-related/sensitivityGuide.html) on that topic which is a reference for myself but also a kind of tutorial. The described methods are applicable to models implemented with [`rodeo`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rodeo), for example. You can help to improve the document by sending me feedback (bug reports, suggestions for simplification or extension). |

# Other software

* The [ECHSE](http://echse.github.io/) framework for rapid development of hydrological model engines (implemented in C++).
