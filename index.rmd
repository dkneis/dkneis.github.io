# R package `rodeo`

## Basic information
[`rodeo`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rodeo) is an add-on package for the statistical computing software [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/). It facilitates the implementation of mechanistic models built on ordinary differential equations (ODE). Its heart is a code generator whose output (Fortran95+ or R) can be passed to numerical solvers, namely those from the packages [deSolve](http://cran.r-project.org/package=deSolve) and [rootSolve](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rootSolve).

The source code is managed in [this github repository](https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo). The current main documentation is the vignette file in PDF format. It can be viewed or downloaded [directly from here](https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo/raw/master/vignettes/rodeo.pdf). If the PDF file does not show up in the browser, please save it to disk first or try to [view it via google docs](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo/raw/master/vignettes/rodeo.pdf).

A release version or `rodeo` is available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rodeo) and can be installed with

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages('rodeo')
```
To install the latest development version instead, one can use

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library('devtools')
install_github('dkneis/rodeo')
```

Interactive modeling examples some of which are implemented with `rodeo` are hosted [here](http://limno-live.hydro.tu-dresden.de) (maintained by TU Dresden, Institute of Hydrobiology).

## Demo examples

There is a collection of examples to demonstrate the functionality of `rodeo`. To try out the examples, you need a recent version of [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) including the developer tools to compile Fortran code. I prepared a short PDF document with [minimalistic instructions](rodeo/instructions/installShort.pdf). In case of problems, please consult the official [administration and installation guide](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html), especially the appendices.

Each of the download links below points to a zip archive. Save the archive to a directory whose name does **not contain white space**, then unpack. This should create a folder containing a file `run.r` as well as several text and/or spreadsheet files. Open the script `run.r` in your preferred R editor or IDE and set R's working directory to the newly created folder, then process `run.r` through R. Adjustable parameters of the models can be found at the top of the script.
