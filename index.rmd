# R package `rodeo`

## Basic information
[`rodeo`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rodeo) is an add-on package for the statistical computing software [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/). It facilitates the implementation of mechanistic models built on ordinary differential equations (ODE). Its heart is a code generator whose output (Fortran95+ or R) can be passed to numerical solvers, namely those from the packages [deSolve](http://cran.r-project.org/package=deSolve) and [rootSolve](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rootSolve).

The extended documentation for the package (vignette in PDF format) is available for [download](https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo/raw/master/vignettes/rodeo.pdf) here and it can also be [viewed](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo/raw/master/vignettes/rodeo.pdf) via google docs. An introductive presentation (PDF file) is provided at [this link](rodeo/presentations/seminarSIAM_20160503.pdf). Interactive modeling examples some of which are implemented with `rodeo` are hosted [here](http://limno-live.hydro.tu-dresden.de) (maintained by TU Dresden, Institute of Hydrobiology).

The latest version is available in the project's [source code repository](https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo). It can be installed as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library('devtools')
install_github('dkneis/rodeo')
```

There is also a release version of `rodeo` on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rodeo). However, due to ongoing development, this version may be somewhat outdated.

## Demo examples

There is a collection of examples to demonstrate the functionality of `rodeo`. To try out the examples, you need a recent version of [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) including the developer tools to compile Fortran code. I prepared a short PDF document with [minimalistic instructions](rodeo/instructions/installShort.pdf). In case of problems, please consult the official [administration and installation guide](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html), especially the appendices.

**Note** that the examples require the latest version from the [source code repository](https://github.com/dkneis/rodeo) to be installed.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Define published examples; extend the list to add more examples contained in the rodeo/(inst/)examples
  examples= list(
    list(file="streeterPhelpsLike", label="Streeter-Phelps"),
    list(file="advectionDispersion", label="Advection-Dispersion")
  )
  archiveDir= "rodeo/exampleArchives"
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# This creates the downloadable archive files
for (i in 1:length(examples)) {
  archive= paste0(archiveDir,"/",examples[[i]]$file,".zip")
  if (file.exists(archive)) 
    file.remove(archive)
  system(paste0("zip -r -j ",archive," ", system.file(paste0("examples/",examples[[i]]$file), package="rodeo")))
}
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
tableOfExamples="| Download | Description |\n|---|---|\n"
for (i in 1:length(examples)) {
  archive= paste0(archiveDir,"/",examples[[i]]$file,".zip")
  descr= readLines(system.file(paste0("examples/",examples[[i]]$file,"/README.txt"),package="rodeo"))
  tableOfExamples= paste0(tableOfExamples,"[",examples[[i]]$label,"](",archive,") | ",descr," |\n")
}
```

Each of the download links below points to a zip archive. Save the archive to a directory whose name does **not contain white space**, then unpack. This should create a folder containing a file `run.r` as well as several text and/or spreadsheet files. Open the script `run.r` in your preferred R editor or IDE and set R's working directory to the newly created folder, then process `run.r` through R. Adjustable parameters of the models can be found at the top of each script.

# R-related material

| Topics               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Sensitivity analysis | Analyzing the sensitivity of models with respect to input parameters is a common task. I wrote a [minimalistic guide](r-related/sensitivityGuide.html) on that topic which is a reference for myself but also a kind of tutorial. The described methods are applicable to models implemented with [`rodeo`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rodeo), for example. You can help to improve the document by sending me feedback (bug reports, suggestions for simplification or extension). |
